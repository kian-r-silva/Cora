5. **Rebuild**: Run `npm run build`
6. **Deploy**: Upload the new `out/` folder

## ðŸ“§ **Current Fallback**
If no service is configured, the form falls back to `mailto:cora@coracolvin.com` which:
- Opens user's email client
- Pre-fills the message
- Requires user to manually send

## ðŸŽ¯ **Recommendation**
**Use Formspree** - it's the easiest and most reliable solution for static sites. Setup takes 5 minutes and provides a professional contact form experience.

## ðŸš€ **After Setup**
1. Test the form on your live site
2. Check that you receive emails
3. Optionally set up autoresponders in your chosen service

The contact form will work much better with any of these services compared to the current mailto fallback!
